**Description:**

Starts on the 2P VS Screen. All characters, stages, and minigames are unlocked. Hazards and items are off, respawn combos are on.

A patch is included, as this build is unique compared to previous releases of True OG v1.1, such as the one that can be found on neoromhacking.net, despite being visually identical and having the same feature set (this one works on OpenBIOS, the other one doesn't). Patch it against the original USA BIN file, and it will match the above patched bin MD5.
