**Description:**

Starts on the 2P VS Screen. All characters, stages, and minigames are unlocked. Hazards and items are off, respawn combos are on.

A patch is included, as this build is unique compared to previous releases of True OG v1.1, such as the one that can be found on neoromhacking.net, despite being visually identical and having the same feature set (this one works on OpenBIOS, the other one doesn't). Patch it against the original USA BIN file, and it will match the above patched bin MD5. The patch was made with [this ppf patch creater](https://neoromhacking.net/utilitypage.php?id=353), which should work with the ppf-o-matic v3.0 that Action seems to like using (tho I'd rather just use that romhacking.net patcher ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯). If the patch doesn't work, please let me know.

I've also included a game settings file that mostly just serves to disable enhancements. A lot of people in the DRA community don't like them, and the ones who don't like them are far more annoyed about having to try and turn them off, then how annoyed those who'd rather use them are about having to turn them on. If you must insist on enhancements being enabled by default, PGXPEnable = true causes desyncs with DRA and must be set to false.
