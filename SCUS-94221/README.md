**Description:**

Start on the world map with the World Debug Menu, Battle Debug Menu, and Hot-Seats Multiplayer Mode unlocked.
In the world map's context menu, additional hidden options are displayed. By manipulating them appropriately, we can set up our party and then start the game on any chosen map. Below is a brief description of these options:

Option 1 - Battle Location Selector:
Select this, and you'll be presented with a submenu, and you can select a number from 001-200 (any battle map from game). When you select a number, you'll be taken to the battle preparation screen, and you'll be prompted to form two squads of up to four people each, who will then fight each other at the location you just selected. The first squad is the 'enemy' squad, the second squad are the 'good guys'. 

Option 2 - Event Flags:
The second hidden option concerns the map and the locations on it. By appropriately manipulating the code, we can eliminate random encounters.

Option 3 - Party Configuration:
This leads to a submenu which allows you to choose from 511 (!) preset party configurations! You can get access to everyone from generic troops, to Ajora and Teta! Unfortunatly, though, once you use this, you'll wipe whatever party config you previously had. No mixing and matching, it seems.

Option 4 - ? No use
