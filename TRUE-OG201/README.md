**Description:**

Starts on the 2P VS Screen. All characters, stages, and minigames are unlocked. Hazards and items are off, respawn combos are on.

New since v1.1:
- Anti-camping measures added to Garbage Recycling Center (No Hazards)
- Characters now flash cyan while invincible, and briefly flash yellow when stunned.
- Basketball minigame available directly in 2P VS
- In game stage striking added to stage select screen
  - Square to strike current stage
  - Circle to auto strike all banned stages (Wild, Revo, Volcano, Reaper's)
  - Triangle can now return you to the main menu from stage select
- Added more music to 2P VS and VS CPU modes
- Minor adjustments to respawn combos off, non-gameplay RNG, pause menu text

Note to Action: Because of the new music, the ROM size is bigger than the original, and thus a PPF patch isn't possible. This repo seems to have a 25MB upload limit, so I also couldn't upload it here directly, so [here's a link to the patch on my repo's releases page](https://github.com/bigger0gamer/TrueOGEdition/releases/download/v2RC1/TRUE-OG201.xdelta) where you can find it. If you have any issues with the patch, just let me know. I also don't want v1.1 removed from the game list just yet, in case any issues arise with the new release. I'll submit another PR to add it to skip.txt in about a week or two.
