**Description:**

The game starts when you take control of Cless, who has 15 Channeling Rings and 15 Technical Rings in his inventory. To allow players 2, 3, and 4 to take control of additional party members, you need to equip those characters with a "Channeling Ring" and a "Tech Ring." The Channeling Ring allows other players to control the characters commands, while the Tech Ring enables free movement on the battle (press "SELECT" button to activate it).
