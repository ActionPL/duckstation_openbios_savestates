**Description:**

Starts on the 2P VS Screen. All characters, stages, and minigames are unlocked.

A patch is included, as this is slightly edited from the patch available on romhacking.net (that one does not change the game ID, this one does). Patch it against the original USA BIN file, and it will match the above patched bin MD5.
