(Track 2 is just audio, like Tetris Plus, but my dump actually matches redump for this game! There also isn't nearly 50 fucking tracks either lol)

Description:

Starts at title screen / main menu. Can't really "skip setup" when this is exactly the kind of game that might not be played with 2 players exactly, or with *only* players (the game has AI opponents to throw in the mix too). There's also just not much setup to begin wtih honestly (besides the whole slew of home rules that can be adjusted, but I left it all at defaults of course). Besides, you'll get the hear the chill menu music, the best part of Monopoly! ~~I want to see Mystery players suffer.~~
