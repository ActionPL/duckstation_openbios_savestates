(All other tracks are audio tracks, and they do not need to match for netplay to sync. My dump only matches on the first and last track, and I honestly forget if I dumped my own disc or if I got it from the internet, and disc scratches can easily cause those other tracks to not match up in hashes because audio tracks don't contain error correction data. If this is a problem, I'll correct my ROM and resubmit.)

Description:

Starts at the main menu. I didn't start it directly in 2P VS because then it would force a set seed, causing the same piece sequence to appear at the start of every netplay session. I also didn't put it over to the VS MODE option by default because the NRRRRRMMMMMMMM slide in sound effect is just too fucking nostalgic for me to cut out, and it's like two presses away! Gives time for the RNG to advance so that you don't always end up on the same RNG seed anyways.
