**Description:**

Co-op mode made possible thanks to Teslafane's work. He extracted and shared Gameshark codes that allow turning the first opponent into a companion character controlled by the second player. Stages layout is forced to C for the most reasonable positioning of the second player. The game starts at the stage selection menu.
