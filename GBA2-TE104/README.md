**Description:**

Starts at title screen, hovering on 2P VS screen. Has all characters and stages unlocked, with all default settings. This is a "Tournament Edition" ROM hack that embeds all the features of the old netplay gameshark codes directly into the game with improvements, bug fixes, and extra quality of life features. The patch file should be applied to Track 1 (Track 2 is just audio data that wasn't modified), and was made with romhacking.net's online rom patcher. I tried makeppf3, but it failed because my Track 1 bin file is smaller than the original... somehow (must be something to do with using psxbuild instead of psxinject).
